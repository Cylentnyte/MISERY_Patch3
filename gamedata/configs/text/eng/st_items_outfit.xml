    <text>CS-3a Battle Armor</text>
  </string>
  <string id="csky_heavy_outfit_description">
    <text>Once the standard outfit for Clear Sky assault squads, this armor remains a legacy from the now-eliminated faction and harshly reminds everyone that even an excellent protective bodysuit cannot guarantee you safety within the Zone. The armor is capable of stopping pistol rounds, while the wearer is also well protected from anomalies. Integrated artifact container included with room for expansion.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="dolg_heavy_outfit_name">
    <text>PSZ-9d Duty Armor</text>
  </string>
  <string id="dolg_heavy_outfit_description">
    <text>An early model of the Duty bodysuit based on the PS5-M, but constructed with newer materials. The result is an outfit capable of stopping all but the most powerful of rifle rounds, an impressive trait sought by Duty for their firefights with Freedom. A knowledgeable technician can even turn this into state-of-the-art body armor by installing several advanced combat and life support systems. Despite this, the sheer weight, poor anomaly protection at best, and inability to possess any artifact containers whatsoever leaves something to be desired for the average stalker.</text>

  <string id="dolg_outfit_name">
    <text>PS5-M Universal Protection</text>
  </string>
  <string id="dolg_outfit_description">
    <text>A modern version of the Duty bodysuit adapted for recruits who prefer lighter outfits. Compared to the PSZ series, this suit offers no upgrades for anomaly resistance and has considerably less protection against small arms fire. The inability to contain any artifacts at all is also major drawback, however the basic combat and life support modifications are highly regarded.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="exo_outfit_name">
    <text>Exoskeleton</text>
  </string>
  <string id="exo_outfit_description">
    <text>A third generation military exoskeleton. These models never went into serial production due to extreme cost and several design flaws. It is, however, illegaly produced in small batches outside of Ukraine. Stalkers have since eliminated the defects, added an anomaly container, reinforced the armor, and implemented anomaly-resistant materials for use in the Zone. Despite not being able to sprint until fourth-generation boosters are installed, this armor is nearly impervious to gunfire when fully upgraded and boasts anomaly protection second only to the coveted SEVA suits.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="military_outfit_name">
    <text>Bulat armored suit</text>
  </string>
  <string id="military_outfit_description">
    <text>This modern armored military suit is designed for ground operations in anomalous areas. It comprises a PSZ-12p military vest, integrated anomalous protection bodysuit, and a pair of built in artifact containers with room for expansion. The advanced vest armor provides excellent protection against bullet and shrapnel damage, without greatly reducing the wearer's mobility. There is also room for combat and life support systems. These suits are issued to expert field operators when exoskeletons are not available, and as such they are top-of-the-line outfits for stalkers who can't yet afford the pricier of the two.</text>

  <string id="mp_exo_outfit_name">
    <text>Exoskeleton</text>
  </string>
  <string id="mp_exo_outfit_description">
    <text>This exoskeleton provides outstanding protection against bullet and fragmentation damage at the cost of mobility. Vulnerable to armor-piercing rounds.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="mp_military_outfit_name">
    <text>Military armored suit</text>
  </string>
  <string id="mp_military_outfit_description">
    <text>A military armored suit made for assault operations. Provides outstanding protection against full metal jacket rounds and fragmentation damage without reducing the wearer's mobility. Vulnerable to armor-piercing rounds.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="mp_scientific_outfit_name">
    <text>SEVA bodysuit</text>
  </string>
  <string id="mp_scientific_outfit_description">
    <text>This bodysuit, intended for conducting research in the Zone, combines a closed-cycle respiratory module and an external isolation coating, resulting in excellent protection from anomalies. Due to poor protection from physical impact, the suit is not a good defense against bullet and fragmentation damage. Comes with a built-in artifact transportation container.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="novice_outfit_name">
    <text>Military overcoat</text>
  </string>
  <string id="novice_outfit_description">
    <text>Standard issue military overcoat. Provides little in the way of protection, but at least the wearer won't freeze to death at night. Comes with two artifact containers.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="scientific_outfit_name">
    <text>SEVA bodysuit</text>
  </string>
  <string id="scientific_outfit_description">
    <text>This suit, produced by one of Kiev's many defense research institutes, is a great alternative to the homemade stalker suits used throughout the Zone. While its lightweight bulletproof vest can stop nothing more than pistol rounds, the anomaly and CBRN protection is second to none. With a few choice modifications the outfit can hold more artifacts than most others, accept the full range of additional CBRN protective measures, and integrate several life support systems, making it the ideal choice for experienced artifact hunters.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="specops_outfit_name">
    <text>Berill-5M Special Operations Suit</text>
  </string>
  <string id="specops_outfit_description">
    <text>A Ukrainian special operations suit, modified for operations within the Zone. The PSZ-9a bulletproof vest with beryllium coating is intended for assault operations in areas with high background radiation and low anomalous activity. The suit makes its way to stalkers through the military, who exchange it for loot. Comes with two built-in artifact containers and expansion opportunities.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_helm_battle">
    <text>Sphere M12 helmet</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_helm_battle_descr">
    <text>Made of aluminium/titanium alloys, this helmet is typically used by Spetznatz in conjunction with PSZ-class armor. Quite popular in the Zone thanks to its respirator and built-in first generation night vision device, as well as providing the maximum head protection possible. Comes with an array of slots for steel plates and other upgrades.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_helm_hardhat">
    <text>Steel helmet</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_helm_hardhat_descr">
    <text>A desperately outdated steel military helmet without any additions. Provides no protection against anomalies or radiation, but can deflect small-caliber rounds and has room for a first-generation night vision device. This helmet was never particularly popular in the Zone, except for use in brief armed conflicts between factions.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_helm_protective">
    <text>Screen helmet</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_helm_protective_descr">
    <text>A lightweight helmet coupled with an airtight visor for protection from anomalies. Judging by the design, the helmet was made by the same defense research institutes as the venerable SEVA bodysuit. Its intended use may very well be in combination with military CBRN outfits for operations in highly anomalous areas.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_helm_respirator">
    <text>Gas mask</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_helm_respirator_descr">
    <text>A standard butyl rubber gas mask designed to filter out radioactive dust and toxins from inspirated air. Widely used by both novices and veterans of all factions due to its versatility. Not designed to protect from bullets, shrapnel or other physical trauma.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_helm_tactic">
    <text>Sphere-08 Tactical helmet</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_helm_tactic_descr">
    <text>A tactical helmet of western design, without any identifiable markings or point of origin. The helmet's interface was designed to provide a squad leader with strategic superiority over the enemy via its many scanners and satellite communications devices, which have not been installed in this particular helmet. Multi-layered Kevlar protection and reinforced electronic component housing comes standard. This one also includes a respirator and first generation night vision device.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="stalker_outfit_name">
    <text>Sunrise bodysuit</text>
  </string>
  <string id="stalker_outfit_description">
    <text>These handmade stalker outfits are an effective combination of twin-layered rubberized fabric and a light military bulletproof vest. Despite the vest's inadequate protection against even small-caliber rounds, the suit enjoys great popularity due to its low cost and modification potential. Comes with built-in artifact containers and room for expansion.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="svoboda_heavy_outfit_name">
    <text>Freedom Guard bodysuit</text>
  </string>
  <string id="svoboda_heavy_outfit_description">
    <text>This stalker bodysuit with reinforced body armor made by Freedom craftsmen represents a good compromise between combat and anomaly protection. The built-in body armor comprises armor plating and ten Kevlar layers, capable of stopping a pistol bullet. The suit uses the relatively expensive Sovereign compound for anomaly protection. Comes with an artifact container.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="svoboda_light_outfit_name">
    <text>Wind of Freedom bodysuit</text>
  </string>
  <string id="svoboda_light_outfit_description">
    <text>This lightweight stalker bodysuit is made by Freedom craftsmen. The suit's fabric is treated with Horizon, a special solution developed by the faction by trial and error to increase resistance to anomalies. Like the Sunrise suit, the Wind of Freedom comes with built-in body armor and artifact containers.</text>
