    <text>CS-3a Battle Armor</text>
  </string>
  <string id="csky_heavy_outfit_description">
    <text>Once the standard outfit for Clear Sky assault squads, this armor remains a legacy from the now-eliminated faction and harshly reminds everyone that even an excellent protective bodysuit cannot guarantee you safety this side of the perimeter. The armor is capable of stopping pistol rounds, while the wearer is also well protected from anomalies. Integrated artifact container included with room for expansion.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="dolg_heavy_outfit_name">
    <text>PSZ-9d Duty Armor</text>
  </string>
  <string id="dolg_heavy_outfit_description">
    <text>An early model of the Duty bodysuit based on the PS5-M, but constructed with newer materials. The result is an outfit capable of stopping all but the most powerful of rifle rounds, an impressive trait sought by Duty for their firefights with Freedom. A knowledgeable technician can even turn this into state-of-the-art body armor by installing several advanced combat and life support systems. Despite this, the sheer weight, poor anomaly protection at best, and inability to possess any artifact containers whatsoever leaves something to be desired for the average stalker.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="dolg_outfit_name">
    <text>PS5-M Universal Protection</text>
  </string>
  <string id="dolg_outfit_description">
    <text>A modern version of the Duty bodysuit adapted for recruits who prefer lighter outfits. Compared to the PSZ series, this suit offers no upgrades for anomaly resistance and has considerably less protection against small arms fire. The inability to contain any artifacts at all is also major drawback, however the basic combat and life support modifications are highly regarded.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="exo_outfit_name">
    <text>Exoskeleton</text>
  </string>
  <string id="exo_outfit_description">
    <text>A third generation military exoskeleton. These models never went into serial production due to extreme cost and several design flaws. It is, however, illegaly produced in small batches outside of Ukraine. Stalkers have since eliminated the defects, added an anomaly container, reinforced the armor, and implemented anomaly-resistant materials for use in the Zone. Despite not being able to sprint until fourth-generation boosters are installed, this armor is nearly impervious to gunfire when fully upgraded and boasts anomaly protection second only to the coveted SEVA suits.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="military_outfit_name">
    <text>Bulat armored suit</text>
  </string>
  <string id="military_outfit_description">
    <text>This modern armored military suit is designed for ground operations in anomalous areas. It comprises a PSZ-12p military vest, integrated anomalous protection bodysuit, and a pair of built in artifact containers with room for expansion. The advanced vest armor provides excellent protection against bullet and shrapnel damage, without greatly reducing the wearer's mobility. There is also room for combat and life support systems. These suits are issued to expert field operators when exoskeletons are not available, and as such they are top-of-the-line outfits for stalkers who can't yet afford the pricier of the two.</text>

    <text>Exoskeleton</text>
  </string>
  <string id="mp_exo_outfit_description">
    <text>This exoskeleton provides outstanding protection against bullet and fragmentation damage at the cost of mobility. Vulnerable to armor-piercing rounds.</text>

    <text>SEVA bodysuit</text>
  </string>
  <string id="mp_scientific_outfit_description">
    <text>This bodysuit, intended for conducting research in the Zone, combines a closed-cycle respiratory module and an external isolation coating, resulting in excellent protection from anomalies. Due to poor protection from physical impact, the suit is not a good defense against bullet and fragmentation damage. Comes with a built-in artifact transportation container.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="novice_outfit_name">
    <text>Military overcoat</text>
  </string>
  <string id="novice_outfit_description">
    <text>Standard issue military overcoat. It will keep the wearer warm at night and give him some protection, it will also let the wearer carry two artefact's.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="scientific_outfit_name">
    <text>SEVA bodysuit</text>
  </string>
  <string id="scientific_outfit_description">
    <text>This suit, produced by one of Kiev's Defense Research Institutes, is a great alternative to homemade stalker suits. While its built-in body armor can only stop a pistol round, the anomaly and radiation protection system is second to none. Fully upgradeable and boasting two built-in artifact containers, this bodysuit is the equipment of choice for many experienced stalkers.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="specops_outfit_name">
    <text>Berill-5M armored suit</text>
  </string>
  <string id="specops_outfit_description">
    <text>This item comprises military PS5 series body armor with beryllium sputter modified for use in the Zone. Designed for assault operations in highly radioactive areas, it is ineffective in areas of high anomalous activity. The suit makes its way to stalkers through the military, who exchange it for loot. Comes with built-in artifact containers.</text>

  </string>
  <string id="st_helm_battle_descr">
    <text>An aluminum/titanium helmet with a cloth exterior that comes with pockets for additional steel armor pieces and an armor face mask. Sphere M12 is normally used as part of a combination that includes PSZ series Spetsnaz body armor. Quite popular in the Zone thanks to its respirator and built-in first generation night vision device, as well as providing the maximum head protection possible. Comes with electronics slots.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_helm_hardhat">
    <text>Steel helmet</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_helm_hardhat_descr">
    <text>A desperately outdated steel army helmet without any additions. Provides no protection against anomalies or radiation, but can deflect bullets. This helmet was never particularly popular in the Zone, except for use in brief armed conflicts between factions.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_helm_protective">
    <text>Screen helmet</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_helm_protective_descr">
    <text>A light helmet with an airtight visor intended for protection from anomalies. Judging by the design, the helmet is made by the same Defense Research Institutes as the SEVA bodysuit. Its intended use may very well be in combination with military suits for operations in highly anomalous areas. </text>

  </string>
  <string id="st_helm_respirator_descr">

    <text>Tactical helmet</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_helm_tactic_descr">
    <text>A Western model of a tactical helmet that lacks camouflage. It is not known how it made its way into the Zone. The helmet is designed to provide a squad leader with strategic superiority over the enemy via its many scanners and satellite communications devices, which have not been installed in this particular helmet. Comes with multi-layered Kevlar protection and armored elements to protect electronic components. Includes a respirator and a first generation night vision device.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="stalker_outfit_name">
    <text>Sunrise bodysuit</text>
  </string>
  <string id="stalker_outfit_description">
    <text>This DIY stalker bodysuit is a combination of a bodysuit of twin-layered rubberized cloth with plexiglass lining and built-in body armor. Despite the fact that the body armor is incapable of protecting the wearer from even pistol bullets, the suit enjoys great popularity due to its low cost and modification potential. Comes with built-in artifact containers.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="svoboda_heavy_outfit_name">
    <text>Freedom Guard bodysuit</text>
  </string>
  <string id="svoboda_heavy_outfit_description">
    <text>This stalker bodysuit with reinforced body armor made by Freedom craftsmen represents a good compromise between combat and anomaly protection. The built-in body armor comprises armor plating and ten Kevlar layers, capable of stopping a pistol bullet. The suit uses the relatively expensive Sovereign compound for anomaly protection. Comes with an artifact container.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="svoboda_light_outfit_name">
    <text>Wind of Freedom bodysuit</text>
  </string>
  <string id="svoboda_light_outfit_description">
